# RMIT-Codewords-MajorProject

In this assignment, I am tasked to research, create, code, and publish a digital creative coding interpretation of an excerpt from one of the critical texts on art and language. Creative coding involves using interactive, multimedia, and generative content in imaginative ways. As an individual, my final published project is a website hosted on GitHub.

With the influx of information and news constantly intertwines, people are often drawn to the flow of keeping up with things are going on around. This is due to various factors, from inevitable work-related issues, to simply just a digital addiction. Regardless of the reason, this constant digital noise not only diminishes our focus and creativity but also contributes to the lack of uninterrupted time spent alone for one's own thoughts, which is called solitude deprivation. This directly impacts people's mental well-being and is becoming an increasingly worsening phenomenon.

Hence the born of my project, Solitude, is the space that advocate the intentional state of being disconnected from other people’s inputs and influences. This space allows for self-reflection, creativity, and the processing of emotions, all of which are crucial for maintaining mental well-being. My main feature is a moon, which has long been a powerful symbol of solitude, evoking a sense of quiet reflection and introspection. Its solitary presence in the night sky, distant yet luminous, embodies the essence of isolation and stillness. 

Worries, doubts, and emotional negativities are the constant barrage of data, notifications, and social media updates surrounds us, creating a chaotic atmosphere that can feel inescapable, just like how the particles surrounds the moon. This imagery conveys how the relentless flow of information can cloud our minds, making it difficult to find clarity and peace. As the particles swirl around the moon, they symbolize the distractions and anxieties that arise from our connected world, contributing to feelings of stress, confusion, and dissatisfaction.

Stands in contrast to the chaos represented by the particles, my choice of bold text “We enter Solitude, in which we also lose loneliness” and a dark, transparent layer surrounding the moon is a source of tranquillity. While acknowledging the intention of the website, it is also differentiating the common mistakes between solitude and loneliness. By framing solitude as a state where loneliness is lost, I reframe Solitude from something negative or empty into something fulfilling and enriching. The presence of these highlights the importance of finding ways to detach from the noise and regain a sense of calm amidst the chaos.

An embedded song, An Ending by Brian Eno, helps in creating an environment conducive to relaxation, allowing for deeper concentration and facilitating self-discovery. The users can immerse themselves to Solitude space by sending their thoughts into the orbit. The orbit will change according to what the users type and send, picturing their own thoughts rotating around the moon. These interactive functions transform Solitude from a potentially daunting experience into a nourishing and enriching one, allowing individuals to fully embrace and enjoy their time alone. 
In today’s fast-paced digital age, the goal is not just to escape our devices but to cultivate a lifestyle that allows us to thrive in solitude. By setting boundaries around screen time and reducing social media use, Solitude transforms into a powerful tool for creativity and self-awareness.

Solitude Space reminds us that true fulfillment comes from within. In this sanctuary, users can listen to their inner voices, find comfort in silence, and embrace the beauty of being alone without feeling lonely. Let them carry the essence of solitude with, committing to embrace stillness in their daily lives.
